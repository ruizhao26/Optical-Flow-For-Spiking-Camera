## Datasets
In this work, two datasets are proposed where SPIkingly Flying Things (SPIFT) is as train set and  Photo-realistic High-speed Motion (PHM) is as test set. You can download them from .
### SPIFT
The dataset includes 100 scenes and each scene describes that different kinds of objects translate and rotate in random background includes spike streams with 500 frames, corresponding GT images and optical flow. Some scenes is shown in Fig. 1.

### PHM
Each scene in the dataset is carefully designed and has a lot in common with the real world as shown in Fig. 2.  Besides, the number of generated spike frames for each scene is shown in Table. 1.
